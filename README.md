# EEE312_DSP_Project
Despite being one of the most widely spoken languages of the world, no significant efforts have been made
in Bangla speech recognition. Speech recognition, in particular
keyword recognition, is a difficult task especially if the demand
is to do so in noisy real-life conditions. With inspiration to
control wheelchairs for handicapped persons with Bangla voice
commands, we tried to develop a keyword recognition system
in this project. Our convolutional neural network model can
recognize five voice commands– ‘shamne’ (forward), ‘pichone’
(back), ‘dane’ (right), ‘bame’ (left) and ‘thamo’ (stop) and a
class for unknown words. Among different feature extractors
such as Mel spectrum, Bark spectrum and Bark spectrum with
the modification of Teager Energy operator, Bark spectrum for
mixed data sets outperformed the others with 93.8% accuracy.
